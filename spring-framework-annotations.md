## Spring Framework Annotations

|Sl.No| Annotation    | Description  |
|-----|---------------|--------------|
| 01. |@Autowired	  |Annotation @Autowired is used to inject object dependency implicitly for a **constructor, field or method**. This is known as “autowired by type” since the object to be injected is discovered by its type. The items declared @Autowired need not have to be public.|				
| 02. |@Configurable  |	Used on classes to inject properties of domain objects. Types whose properties are injected without being instantiated by Spring can be declared with @Configurable annotation.	|
| 03. |@Qualifier	  |It can be used to create more than one bean of the same type and wire only one of the types with a property. It provides greater control on the dependency injection process and can be used with @Autowired annotation.|
| 04. |@Required	  |Used to mark class members that are mandatory. The Spring auto-configuration fails if a particular property specified with this annotation cannot be injected.|
| 05.  |@ComponentScan|Make Spring scan the package for the @Configuration clases.|
| 06.  |@Configuration|It is used on classes that define beans.|
| 07.  |@Bean	      |It indicates that a method produces a bean which will be mananged by the Spring container.|			
| 08.  |@Lazy	      |Makes a @Bean or @Component to be initialized only if it is requested.|		
| 09.  |@Value	      |It is used to inject values into a bean’s attribute from a property file. @Value annotation indicates a default value expression for the field or parameter.|	
| 10.  |@Resource     |Annotation used to inject an object that is already in the Appl­ication Context. It searches the instance by name. It also works on setter methods.|
| 11.  |@Primary      |Annotation used when no name is provided telling Spring to inject an object of the annotated class first. Used along with @Comp­onent.|
| 12.  |@Component    |Generic stereotype annotation used to tell Spring to create an instance of the object in the Appl­ication Context. It's possible to define any name for the instance, the default is the class name as camel case.|
| 13.  |@Contr­oller   |Stereotype annotation for presen­tation layer.|
| 14.  |@Repos­itory   |Stereotype annotation for persis­tence layer. |
| 15.  |@Service      |Stereotype annotation for service layer.     |


#### Spring-Boot Web Annotations

|Sl.No| Annotation            | Description  |
|-----|-----------------------|--------------|
| 01. |@SpringBootApplication |	This annotation is used to qualify the main class for a Spring Boot project. The class used with this annotation must be present in the base path. @SpringBootApplication scans for sub-packages by doing a component scan.|   			
| 02. |@EnableAutoConfiguration|Based on class path settings, property settings, new beans are added by Spring Boot by using this annotation.|					
| 03. |@Controller	           |Allows detection of component classes in the class path automatically and register bean definitions for the classes automatically.|					
| 04. |@RestController	       |Used in controllers that will behave as RESTful resources. @RestController is a convenience annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody.	|				
| 05. |@ResponseBody	       |Makes Spring to convert the returned object to a response body. This is useful for classes exposed as RESTful resources.|				
| 06. |@RequestMapping	       |Used to map web requests to specific handler classes and methods, based on the URI.|
| 07. |@RequestParam	       |This annotation is used to bind request parameters to a method parameter in your controller.| 
| 08. |@PathVariable	       |This annotations binds the placeholder from the URI to the method parameter and can be used when the URI is dynamically created or the value of the URI itself acts as a parameter.	|	



#### Profile

|Sl.No| Annotation            | Description  |
|-----|-----------------------|--------------|
| 01. |spring.profiles.active |Property to be set in appl­ica­tio­n.p­rop­ert­ies in order to tell Spring what profiles are active.|
| 02. |@Profile("dev")       |Annotation used to define which profile can execute the annotated method.|


#### Aspect Annotations

|Sl.No| Annotation     |USE       | Description  |
|-----|----------------|----------|--------------|
| 01. |@Aspect         |Type      |Declares a class to be an aspect.|
| 02. |@After          |Method    |Declares a method to be called after a pointcut completes.|
| 03. |@AfterReturning |Method    |Declares a method to be called after a pointcut returns successfully.|
| 04. |@AfterThrowing  |Method    |Declares a method to be called after a pointcut throws an exception.|
| 05. |@Around         |Method    |Declares a method that will wrap the pointcut.|
| 06. |@Before         |Method    |Declares a method to be called before proceeding to the pointcut.|
| 07. |@DeclareParents |Static Field |Declares that matching types should be given new parents,that is, it introduces new functionality into matching types.|
| 08. |@Pointcut       |Method    |Declares an empty method as a pointcut placeholder method.|


#### Spring-Boot Testing Annotations

|Sl.No| Annotation            | Description  |
|-----|-----------------------|--------------|
| 01.  |@AfterTransaction	  |Annotation used to identify which method needs to be invoked after a transaction is completed.|
| 02.  |@BeforeTransaction	  |Used to identify the method to be invoked before a transaction starts executing.	|			
| 03.  |@ContextConfiguration |Declares the annotated classes which will be used to load the context for the test. The location of the configuration file has to be povided to Spring.|					
| 04.  |@DirtiesContext	      |This annotation indicates the test(s) modify or corrupt the SpringApplicationContext and that it should be closed. Hence, context is reloaded before the next test is executed.|					
| 05. |@ExpectedException	  |The test method is expected to throw a particular exception, else the test fails.|
| 06. |@WebAppConfiguration	  |Used to create web version of the application context.	|				
| 07. |@Repeat	              |Specifies the test method to be executed multiple times.	|				
| 08. |@Transactional 	      |Describes transaction attributes on a method or class.	|				
| 09. |@Rollback	          |Indicates if the transaction of a test method must be rolled back after the execution of the test completed.	|     			
| 10. |@Commit	              |Indicates that the transaction of a test method must be committed after the execution of the test completed.|     		
| 11. |@Timed	              |Indicates the time limit for the test method. If the test has not completed execution before the time expires, the test fails.|					
| 12. |@TestPropertySource	  |Annotation specifies the property sources for the test class.|					
| 13. |@Sql	                  |Annotation declares a test class/method to run SQL scripts against a database.|
